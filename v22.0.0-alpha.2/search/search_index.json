Execute the binary, ensure that the terminal is not closed ./scuridedgeagent-linux-xxx If you do require to close the terminal you can run the service in the background and then disown , e.g. ./scuridedgeagent-linux-arm7 & disown The agent by default logs out some of the default configurations like the port details etc., additionally the agent starts listening on localhost","title":"Step 3 : Deploying Scurid Edge Agent on your IoT hardware"},{"location":"releasenotes/","text":"Release Notes June 13, 2022 General changes Scurid Platform App Enhanced UX with grid and table structure for Scurid Edge Agent and device identities Added identities count summary for each agent #SPA-206 Users will now be able to reference agent identities with alias #SPA-202 Scurid Backend Easy identifiable names for agents, when not defined by the user #SPA-209 Bug Fixes Scurid Platform App Incorrect Scurid App binary name #SPA-212 Fixed empty device context SPA-210 Fixed Scurid Edge Agent name truncation during window resizing #SPA-201 Scurid Backend Fixed issue with new installation unable to find Settings subsystem #SPA-214 Fixed missing timestamp on Agent identity post reverification process SPA-204","title":"Scurid Release Notes"},{"location":"releasenotes/#release-notes","text":"","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"releasenotes/#june-13-2022","text":"","title":"June 13, 2022"},{"location":"releasenotes/#general-changes","text":"","title":"General changes"},{"location":"releasenotes/#scurid-platform-app","text":"Enhanced UX with grid and table structure for Scurid Edge Agent and device identities Added identities count summary for each agent #SPA-206 Users will now be able to reference agent identities with alias #SPA-202","title":"Scurid Platform App"},{"location":"releasenotes/#scurid-backend","text":"Easy identifiable names for agents, when not defined by the user #SPA-209","title":"Scurid Backend"},{"location":"releasenotes/#bug-fixes","text":"","title":"Bug Fixes"},{"location":"releasenotes/#scurid-platform-app_1","text":"Incorrect Scurid App binary name #SPA-212 Fixed empty device context SPA-210 Fixed Scurid Edge Agent name truncation during window resizing #SPA-201","title":"Scurid Platform App"},{"location":"releasenotes/#scurid-backend_1","text":"Fixed issue with new installation unable to find Settings subsystem #SPA-214 Fixed missing timestamp on Agent identity post reverification process SPA-204","title":"Scurid Backend"},{"location":"zero-trusttotrustedIdentityforyourIoTDevice/","text":"This tutorial provides a simplified overview on generating, approving device identity with APIs, and approving it using Scurid Platform App. Step 1. Generate an identity Edge agent is required to run directly on the device, and it exposes gRPC based APIs for your IoT software to interact with. In order to register and monitor the identities generated by each agent you must tell the agent where the Scurid backend is running.
